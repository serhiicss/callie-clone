# Team:

# Plan of action:
~~1. Create repository on GitHub~~
<br>
~~2. Add contributors to the repo~~
<br>
3. Start coding

### Coding:
The page is broken down into 3 sections:
<br>
1. Header or Hero (description of the product)<br>
2. Main section (product features)<br>
3. Footer (instructions)<br>

### Code style:
Please use tab size 2 indent. You can set it in your code editor.
<br>
Please comment end tags: 
`<div class="foobar">lorem ipsum</div> <!-- foobar -->`

~~## Task 1:##~~ Done
**Create index.html and styles.css files. Link styles.css and bootstrap to index.html.**

~~## Task 2:##~~ Done
~~**Header**~~
<br>
The header section has a  linear-gradient background https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient. Colors used for the background are #f85032 and #f0b55d.
<br>
It has an h1 title and a description.
<br>
There is an image in the center that only visible on screen size 1300px or larger.
<br>
There is also an "Add to Slack" button at the bottom.
<br>

## Task 3:
**Section**
<br>
In this section we only have 3 features of the bot. Eeach feature has an icon that comes with bootstrap. Here is how to use them http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons-how-to-use
<br>
The features of the bot must be positioned in a row on large screens and in a column on mobile.

## Task 4:
**Footer**
<br>
Footer consists of 2 items: a text in a box and an ordered list of instructions. The background uses linear-gradient just like the header.
<br>
**Tips:** for the text in a box, use `max-width` to control box width. Colors for the background are #000dff and #ba008c.
